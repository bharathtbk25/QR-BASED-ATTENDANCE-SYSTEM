### QR BASED ATTENDENCE SYSTEM USING PYTHON

Before we get started, you need to install some libraries. 

1. First of all you will need **Python 3.5** or more in your computer. You can easily check if it is installed by typing "python" in your terminal/command prompt. If not, [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) .

2. Now you need **OpenCV**. For this, you can run the command ***pip install opencv-python*** and ***pip install opencv-contrib-python*** and it is used for video capture. Here is a detailed information of how you can [install OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).

3. The otherlibraries that you need is numpy, pyzbar, myqr, pybase64. They are used to create qr code, encode and decode the data ,the images path and load them into our program. To install it, run ***pip install Pyzbar*** this command on your terminal.

NOTE: If you are using python 2 or other older versions you need to install sys, time and os modules

That's it! You can now start writing your own programs and access OpenCV's power to do various Computer Vision projects. So let's get started with QR BASED ATTENDENCE SYSTEM USING PYTHON.

### QR CODE GENERATION

> python generate.py
Has all the functions related to generate the qr codes for candidates

### MARKING ATTENDANCE

> python attend.py
Has all the functions related to reading data, marking attendence etc...


**Yeaahhh!** You have used the powers of OpenCV and Python for qr based attendance system. This can be further used for many applications where qr based attendance system can be implemented to build some interesting projects. There are many more advanced algorithms you can explore if this domain excites you. That's all I'hv got to share in this repo. Thanks for exploring the code and hope you enjoyed it!

**Happy Coding**
